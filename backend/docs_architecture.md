# PVTElA Architecture Overview

## High-Level Architecture

PVTElA is built on a modular service-oriented architecture using Flask as the web framework and SQLAlchemy as the ORM. The system is designed for extensibility, security, and testability.

### Key Components

- **Flask App:** Entry point, configures blueprints and extensions.
- **Blueprints:** Route grouping for registration, login, KYC, profile, etc.
- **Services:** Contain business logic for OTP, KYC, security, notifications, etc.
- **Models:** SQLAlchemy models for users, sessions, KYC submissions, profiles, and audit logs.
- **Tests:** Pytest-based suite covering all flows.

## Security Considerations
- OTP and session rate limiting
- Device/IP fingerprinting
- Audit logging for sensitive actions
- Manual KYC review (MVP)

---

## Extending the Architecture
- Add new blueprints for features (e.g., wallet, payments)
- Add new models/services as needed
- Swap in production-ready integrations (e.g., real KYC APIs, Redis for rate limiting)
